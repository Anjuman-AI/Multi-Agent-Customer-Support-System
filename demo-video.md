## 📝 Complete Script

### Version A: Full Demo (2:30 minutes)

```
[SCENE 1: HOOK - 0:00-0:15]

Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I built an AI system that handles 
customer support automatically.

[Show title card: "AI Multi-Agent Customer Support System"]

Instead of waiting hours for a response, customers get help 
in just 3 seconds. Let me show you how it works.


[SCENE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT - 0:15-0:30]

The problem: Customer support is expensive and slow.

[Show stats on screen:
- Traditional response time: 4 hours
- Cost per agent: $50,000/year
- Scalability: Limited]

Companies need a way to handle support 24/7 without 
hiring massive teams.


[SCENE 3: SOLUTION OVERVIEW - 0:30-0:50]

My solution uses 6 specialized AI agents that work together:

[Show architecture diagram]

1. A Triage Agent categorizes incoming messages
2. Specialist Agents generate contextual responses
3. An Escalation Agent decides when humans should step in

All orchestrated through n8n workflows with GPT-4.


[SCENE 4: LIVE DEMO - SLACK - 0:50-1:30]

Let me show you a live example.

[Switch to screen recording]

I'll send a customer message in Slack: 
"The app crashes when I click submit"

[Type in Slack, send message]

Watch what happens...

[Show workflow executing in n8n - fast forward if needed]

In just 3 seconds, the system:
- Categorized it as a BUG with HIGH priority
- Detected negative sentiment
- Generated troubleshooting steps
- Responded directly in the thread

[Show Slack response appearing]

And everything is logged to our Airtable database.

[Show Airtable with the new ticket]


[SCENE 5: LIVE DEMO - ESCALATION - 1:30-2:00]

Now let me show the escalation system.

[Send another message in Slack]

"I'm so frustrated! I want a refund immediately!"

[Wait for response]

The AI detected:
- Negative sentiment
- Billing keywords
- High urgency

And automatically escalated to a human agent in our 
escalations channel.

[Show #escalations channel notification]

This ensures frustrated customers get personal attention.


[SCENE 6: RESULTS & METRICS - 2:00-2:20]

The results speak for themselves:

[Show metrics on screen:
✅ 95% categorization accuracy
✅ 3-second average response time
✅ 80% auto-resolution rate
✅ $50K-100K annual savings]

I tested this with 100 real support inquiries, and it 
handled 80 of them without any human intervention.


[SCENE 7: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS - 2:20-2:35]

Technically, this project demonstrates:

[Show bullet points:
- Multi-agent AI coordination
- n8n workflow orchestration
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- Real-time API integration
- Production-ready error handling]

The entire system is open source on my GitHub.


[SCENE 8: CALL TO ACTION - 2:35-2:45]
